### Generative AI Fundamentals

Dive into generative AI with this course, which explores its fundamental principles and relationship to prior artificial intelligence innovations. We will walk through popular generative models and how they work, how deep learning models are developed using tools like PyTorch and Hugging Face, and finally, how to customize pre-trained open-source models for a specific use case. In the project, you will apply a cutting-edge technique called parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which allows for the adaptation of massive foundation models with minimal usage of computational resources.

### Large Language Models (LLMs) & Text Generation

Dive deeper into how computers understand and create language, and learn how to build a custom chatbot using unsupervised machine learning, prompt engineering, and retrieval augmented generation. We'll start with a high-level overview of the types of LLMs, the differences between them, and how best to account for their strengths and weaknesses. Then we'll get into the internal details, including natural language processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization, as well as modern transformer architectures and attention mechanisms. Finally, we'll build a practical LLM application that combines an LLM with a custom dataset.

### Computer Vision and Generative AI

Learn how computers process and understand image data, then harness the power of the latest Generative AI models to create new images.

### Building Generative AI Solutions

Gain the skills to build advanced AI systems with real-world impact. Start by teaching AI to interpret human language through semantic search, then manage complex data structures with vector databases. Get hands-on with LangChain to develop adaptive language models, gaining the expertise to bring AI-driven solutions to life. With a focus on practical applications across industries, you’ll learn to create user-friendly AI solutions that truly stand out. By the end, you’ll be equipped to design innovative systems that redefine what’s possible, ready to apply your expertise wherever AI can make a difference.

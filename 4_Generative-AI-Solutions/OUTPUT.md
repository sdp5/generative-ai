Suburb Description: North Adelaide is a predominantly residential precinct and suburb of the City of Adelaide in South Australia, situated, close to Central Business District, north of the River Torrens and within the Adelaide Park Lands. Laid out in a grid plan in three sections by Colonel William Light in 1837, the suburb contains many grand old mansions. North Adelaide is well served by road, although in peak hour some roads, particularly O'Connell Street and Melbourne Street, are quite congested.
